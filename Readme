By using Python and Flask Framework, the webpage was created. This had the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of the Home applicances( Fan, TV, LightBulb etc) and could be controlled via buttons from the page. 


The web page will allow the user to control (send orders) RPi GPIO Pins over the internet, Example: If I am in America and my house in India I will be able to control my Indian's house lights and any appliances that connected to the PI GPIO over the internet. That's Cool Right!!
The Flask Microframework & Python is used to turn our RPi to a Local Web Server, we will use Python to talk to the web server, also we will use HTML and CSS to make a web Page.
